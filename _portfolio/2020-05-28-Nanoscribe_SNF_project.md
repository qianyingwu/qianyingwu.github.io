Highlights of this project
---------
1. Developed an SOP for using Nanoscribe with patterned reflective (metallic) substrates and
characterize how these surfaces affect writing parameters.
2. Developed an SOP for the electrodeposition on small 3D photoresist templates and the removal of
these sacrificial templates.
