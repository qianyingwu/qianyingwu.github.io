Hello! Wish you are doing as best as you can during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Like everyone else, I am spending a lot of time staying at home. My roommate and I take turns in cooking and we have meals together. Inspired by my father, I became interested to experiment on low-temperature cooking, aka Sous Vide, at home. I found that Sous Vide is quite popular because it is said to create a uniform "readiness" of the item. While for stove-top cooking, I sometimes see the item is raw inside when the outside is well done. The working principle for Sous Vide is simple - immerse the item (sealsed in a vacuum bag) in a water bath that maintains a constant but low temperature ~ 120-140ºF (50-60ºC), for 1-3 hours typically.  

However, commercial Sous Vide units are pretty expensive (~$100) for an amateur cook like me. Given that a constant temperature water bath is the only thing needed, I decided to try it in a simple way.

So here is how I implement it, with a pot plugged into a temperature controller that turns the pot on and off based on the feedback from a thermocouple.

Hardware
------
- a pot that could start heating once it is plugged in
- a temperature controller

For the pot, some advanced pots with smart functionalities may not be ideal, especially if they need us to push buttons before they turn on the heater. I tried out the pots we have in the kitchen and found one that works.

For the temperature controller, they are easily available online (~$30). For folks that would like to dive into it, programming an Arduino board might worth trying.
