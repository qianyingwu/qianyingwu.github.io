This project is part of ME352C class taught by Professor John Eaton in Spring 2020 on convective heat transfer. Many thanks to the teaching team!

# Highlights

1. Provided the calculation of a conductive ﬂat plate being heated by a laminar ﬂow and impingement cooled on both surfaces, respectively, under steady state conditions using discrete Green’s functions
2. Developed a technique of formulating conjugate heat transfer problems with the convection terms calculated using DGF method, which should be readily applicable to other scenarios, and elucidated the importance of conducting conjugate analysis to the problem by showing the diﬀerence in temperature distributions with and without consideration of plate conduction, and discussed the inﬂuence of plate thickness on the uniformity of the plate temperature
3. Demonstrated methods to increase the dimensions of the DGF matrix with limited analytical solutions. The derived DGF matrix improved the resolution of the DGF solutions for stagnation ﬂows to 8 × 8. This can be applicable to a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, which is useful for other applications
